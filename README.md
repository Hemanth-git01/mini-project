The "Anti-Sleep Alarm for Drivers" project aims to enhance road safety by developing a system that monitors a driver's alertness and provides a warning when signs of drowsiness are detected. This system uses sensors, such as infrared or cameras, to track eye movement, blink rate, and head position, identifying early indicators of fatigue. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alarm to wake the driver, preventing accidents caused by falling asleep at the wheel. The project focuses on creating an affordable, easy-to-install device that can be used in any vehicle, significantly reducing the risk of fatigue-related accidents.

OBJECTIVES :

-> Early Detection of Drowsiness: The system should be capable of detecting early signs of drowsiness or fatigue in the driver. This can be accomplished using various sensors or technologies such as eye-tracking, facial recognition, steering wheel sensors, or by monitoring physiological signals like heart rate and brain activity.

-> Reliable Alert Mechanism: Upon detecting drowsiness or fatigue, the system should trigger a reliable and effective alert to the driver. This alert can be auditory (alarms), tactile (vibrations), or visual (flashing lights or on-screen messages), ensuring the driver is promptly warned to take corrective action.
